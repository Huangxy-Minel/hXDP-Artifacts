Artifacts for "hXDP: Efficient Software Packet Processing on FPGA NICs"

# Overview
* Getting Started (10 human-minutes + 5 compute-minutes)
* Build Stuff (2 human-minutes + 1 compute-hour)
* Run Experiments (5 human-minutes + 3 compute-hours) 
* Validate Results (30 human-minutes + 5 compute-minutes)
* How to reuse beyond paper (20 human-minutes)

# Getting Started (10 human-minutes + 5 compute-minutes)
* Follow the instructions at XYZ to run our VM/container (10 minutes read).
* Run `./install.sh` and go grab a coffee (5 minutes to install). 
  - You will see no output while the script runs. 
  - The script accesses the internet to download external dependencies such as Qux and Baz.
  - Once complete, it will have created a directory called `stuff`.
  - If this command fails, you can delete the `stuff` directory and try again.

# Build Stuff (2 human-minutes + 1 compute-hour)
* Run `./build.sh stuff` and get some lunch -- this should take ~1 hour to complete. 
  - You should see a progress bar while the command runs.
  - Once complete, it will have created a `BUILD` directory. 
  - If the `BUILD` directory already exists, it will be overwritten.
