Artifacts for "hXDP: Efficient Software Packet Processing on FPGA NICs"

# Overview
* Getting Started (10 human-minutes + 5 compute-minutes)
* Build Stuff (2 human-minutes + 1 compute-hour)
* Run Experiments (5 human-minutes + 3 compute-hours) 
* Validate Results (30 human-minutes + 5 compute-minutes)
* How to reuse beyond paper (20 human-minutes)

# Getting Started (10 human-minutes + 5 compute-minutes)
In this section, we will depict the hardware and software infrastructure needed to validate the results on the paper.
## Hardware Requirements
* A [NetFPGA-SUME](https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-SUME-public/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide) Board connected to the host system's PCI-e bus
* A 4x10Gbe NIC (in our tests, we've used a ...)
